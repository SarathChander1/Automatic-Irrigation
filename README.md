We thoroughly try to understand that this is programmed in such a way that it will sense the moisture level of the plants and supply the water if required automatically This type of system is often used for general plant care, as part of caring for small and large gardens. Normally, the plants need to be watered twice daily, morning and evening. So, the microcontroller has to be coded to water the plants in the greenhouse about two times per day. People enjoy plants, their benefits and the feeling related to nurturing them. However for most people it becomes challenging to keep them healthy and alive. To solve this problem we made a project for those who cannot water the plant due to their busy schedule or when they go outside for long time.
The system automation is designed to be assistive to the user.We hope that through this project people will enjoy having plants without the challenges related to absent .


A.	Methodology:	
    The project is designed to develop an automatic irrigation system which switches the pump motor ON/OFF on sensing the moisture content of the soil. 
  In the field of agriculture, the use of proper methods of irrigation is important. The advantage of using this method is to reduce human intervention and still ensure proper irrigation. The project uses an 8051 series microcontroller which is programmed to receive the input signal of varying moisture conditions of the soil through the sensing arrangement.
This is achieved by using an op-amp as a comparator which acts as an interface between the sensing arrangement and the microcontroller.
